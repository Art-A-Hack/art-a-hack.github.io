An interactive multimedia installation addressing the topic of cultural identity and the impact of its loss on the individual in the context of the technological revolution. The war in Ukraine and its accompanying information warfare raise questions about cultural identity, its roots, to what extent it belongs to us, and how of that identity is imposed on us.

The installation would be located in two dark rooms or segments (preferably the basement of the gallery). In the first, a photograph is taken of the entire figure of the person entering the first room. In addition, the person has to say something, so that their voice is recorded. The material thus taken is processed by two AI models - one language, the other visual. In the next room, the person sees a projection of themselves on a thin fabric, and hears their own voice, with which they can hold a conversation. The image morphs into figures of gods from different eras and cultures with the voice becoming increasingly authoritarian and robotic. In the final phase the image deforms and the voice no longer resembles any familiar person.
