*Language Is Leaving Me* is an interactive mixed media installation performance interrogating the relationship between visual (cinematic, not static) artificial intelligence, epigenetic or inherited traumatic memories of cultures of diaspora, biometrics, and algorithmic justice.

It deploys AI based visual and sonic environments co-driven by non-invasive biometric sensors strategically placed on a human participant to modulate multi-tiered scenes of epigenetic memories of cultures of diaspora embedded deep within the human biological corpus. Using films of a narrated traumatic memory as its source training material, images are run through both the image to image and text to image algorithms of Stable Diffusion. The setup uses the Automatic1111 interface and is hosted on a private server, equipped with a high-end GPU and connected to a research network. Diasporic memories compare and contrast with contemporary image bank representations splintered apart from their original context. Using linguistic scripts in Yiddish, Mandarin, Tamil, and Xhosa these prompts algorithmically tagged and fed into Stable Diffusion’s algorithms. This interrogation of probability matches produces a type of system aphasia misrepresenting and distorting English language-based visuals of psychological and biological based epigenetic wounding.
