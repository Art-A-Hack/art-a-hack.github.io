This piece casts  AI as an actor in a threatening landscape creating a historical-fiction scenario exploring present-day intersections of inherited trauma, digital post-memory, and apocalyptic anxiety. A 2.5 meter steel structure stands in the center of the room with a bell hanging from it, attached to a wooden carcass of a heifer by a long black rope. A screen inside the heifer's abdomen shows a wolf limping through a 3D landscape. A recording of the song "Blue Moon" plays in the otherwise empty space.
