An interactive cinematic installation exploring the relationship between AI cinema, epigenetic or inherited traumatic memories of cultures of diaspora, biometrics, performance, and algorithmic justice.

The installation, located in a dark room or segment, consists of three elements: a film projected on the walls or a screen, sound emitted from the speakers, and a chair where one of the people visiting the installation sits. This person is voluntarily connected to a portable device that records their EMG signal (signal coming from the muscles). The collected signal is used in real time to modulate the film’s sound. Other people visiting the exhibition can move freely in this space, watching the film, listening to the narration and sound, and observe the central person. The video is a montage of the original image and its five AI-created iterations. As such it requires a large screen or a white wall.
