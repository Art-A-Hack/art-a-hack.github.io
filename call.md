**Art-A-Hack <sup>(TM)</sup>** is an open call for artists and engineers, serious maker/creative/technical shoot-for-the stars dreamers who would like to come together to make a BIG impact with some of the newest equipment on the planet.

Here's the deal: We will provide **space** for three Saturdays in June and July, some **equipment**, listed below (which you are free to use or not use), **facilitation** and **advice**, and a stellar **showcase** opportunity. All you need to bring is an open mind and your usual skill set, be it as a maker/engineer, or a creative artist. 

We want to hear your ideas and we will team you up with like minded souls. We will select three groups to blast off into the stratosphere together.

For 3 Saturdays, **June 28**, **July 12** and **July 19** we can co-create at ThoughtWorks @ 99 Madison Avenue, and come up something that has never been before. There are no restrictions on what you make, so long as you can make it with the existing equipment or can provide your own between your collaborators.

We will then have a well-earned closing party where you can present your final work (prototype, artwork, idea), chat and network and land back on the planet.

Please send your ideas to 
[art-a-hack@jahya.net](mailto:art-a-hack@jahya.net)

We really want to work with you!
