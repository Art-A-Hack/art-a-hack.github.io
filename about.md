Art-A-Hack is about bringing artists, engineers and technology together, to make something new.

We are inspired by the possibilities at the intersection of technology and art, and we believe that some of the most interesting innovations take place when people with different ideas and skills get together with an open mind. So, we propose an experiment in which individual artists and technologist get together and create - with no restrictions.

We'll be providing space to work, equipment to get your teeth into, facilitation and showcase opportunities. Check out our [call for participation here](/posts/2014/05/21/call-for-participation/), or sign up to the [Volumetric Society meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/volumetric/) to be kept up-to-date with public events.
