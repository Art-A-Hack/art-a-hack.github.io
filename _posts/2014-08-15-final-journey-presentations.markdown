Having completed our first round of hacking, our teams walked us through their journeys at the awesome new events space <a href="http://new.livestream.com/">Livestream Public</a> in Bushwick. Each team presented on-stage and showed us some of their outcomes and demos.

Thanks to Livestream we have archived <a href="/summer-2014/journey-presentations/">video of the whole show</a>. However I'd suggest leafing through through our photos below - there are some great shots.

A great evening and looking forward to doing it all again for season 2!
