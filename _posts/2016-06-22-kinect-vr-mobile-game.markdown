What kinds of experiences are possible when you match room-sized body tracking with untethered, mobile VR?

The 'Kinect VR' team is building a virtual reality game that will showcase the power of their [KinectVR]("http://kinectvr.com/") plugin for the 3D gaming framework [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

<!--excerpt-ends-->

The plugin allows you to share skeletal data on human movement from the Kinect into your games in realtime. When playing for example, swinging your arm in the real world means swinging a sword in the game world.

We are now in the second week of this year's Art-A-Hack, and team-member Filip Baba &#8212; also one of the tutors behind [Unity Education](http://unityeducation.com) &#8212; started the day by getting everyone set up running Unity and Kinect VR.

By mid-day everyone had the software up and running and started building out a basic framework to start working on their own VR experience concepts.

There are two more weeks to go and already [Pierre Bernard](http://twitter.com/pierrevbernard) is working on a 'Mario Galaxy like mini-planet'.

Meanwhile, [Qiu Yi (Chewy)](http://www.wasinfall.com/) has recorded herself playing the keyboard using motion capture, which she intends to turn into a game object. You can check out her wonderful [impromptu performance here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_NLJdPUixo).

We're excited to see what kind of world this team will create together over the remaining two weeks.
