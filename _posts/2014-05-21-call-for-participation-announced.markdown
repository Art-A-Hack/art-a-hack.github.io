We are inspired by the possibilities at the intersection of technology and art. We also believe that some of the most interesting innovations take place when people with different ideas and skills get together with an open mind.

Therefore we are happy to announce our first call for participation! We are organizing a collaborative creation between three sets of artists and engineers, to take place in New York over three weekends in June/July. Be kept up to date on events at [the Volumetric Society](http://www.meetup.com/volumetric/).

We are looking for people to join the fun - check out our [open call for participation](/call) and apply now!
