A lot of fun was had last night at the 2016 season kick-off social event at ThoughtWorks NYC, at a twinned event with the <a href="http://hardwarehacklab.io">Hardware Hack Lab</a>.

Meeting for the first time, our many groups of Art-A-Hackers got together and discussed their projects. The teams were all looking forward to the co-working sessions ahead.

Program directors Ellen Pearlman and Andrew McWilliams were on hand to talk to the participants about how they will get started and what to expect. When the co-creation begins on Saturday, participants will be spread across venues at ThoughtWorks NYC, and NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn.


During the social, the Art-A-Hackers got the chance to meet and discover who each other are, check out some of the equipment and facilities on offer at ThoughtWorks, and think about what skills they each bring to their collaborations.

We are now looking forward to our first co-creation day, this Saturday!
