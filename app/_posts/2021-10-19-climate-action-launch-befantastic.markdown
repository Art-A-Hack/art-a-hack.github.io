Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), as well as data and networks, Art-A-Hack has brought together a diverse group of global practitioners to create collaborative artworks that amplify voices and rapid prototyping responses to the climate emergency.

Participants gained free training in strategies to tackle the climate emergency, AI/ML and tech and ideation during the month of August, and met an international group of like-minded people to discuss how to cultivate impactful, collaborative work, without borders. Participants have had the opportunity to form 11 teams during the month of September, developing prototypes and artworks, with the support of experienced mentors, including [Andy McWilliams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BtDWV5tkTM&t=3927s) and [Ellen Pearlman](https://youtu.be/RZR2FT-_-jw?t=2811). Mentors also presented on how art and technology can intervene in the climate crisis, in the program series *Dialogue: TechArt + Climate*.
