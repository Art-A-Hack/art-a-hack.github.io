title : Announcing Teams for Art-A-Hack Special Edition 2020 COVID19 - “DANCEDEMIC”
---
We are pleased to announce the international group of participants for Art-A-Hack's "DANCEDEMIC". For this year’s summer program we have divided individuals into two teams. <!--excerpt-ends-->Each team has been carefully formed with creative technologists of diverse backgrounds to collaborate on  a live-streamed performance using the biometrics of two renowned dancers, Hussein Smko (Iraq/NY)and Razvan Stoian (Romania/NY) currently in fellowship at [Battery Dance](https://batterydance.org/).

The isolation and lockdown of COVID-19 is the catalyst for conceptualizing interactive live performance in new ways. This will be the first-ever Art-A-Hack where all participants are collaborating both internationally and remotely from their respective homes or studios located in India, Estonia, Ukraine, London, Brazil, and both the west and east coasts of the United States.

Art-A-Hack's "DANCEDEMIC" is in collaboration with [Battery Dance Festival](https://batterydance.org/battery-dance-festival/), [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), [Emotibit](https://www.emotibit.com/), [eˉlektron](https://elektron.art/en/), and [U.S. State Department Alumni TIES](https://alumni.state.gov/alumni-news/alumni-thematic-international-exchange-seminars-alumni-ties) / [World Learning](https://www.worldlearning.org/program/alumni-thematic-international-exchange-seminars/). You can learn more about how this year’s Art-A-Hack is structured via the [Open Call](https://artahack.io/summer-2020/call/). The call closed in June, after which the applications were sorted and reviewed multiple times to create the following two teams:
