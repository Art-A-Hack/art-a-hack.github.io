We are now right in the middle of our experiment. The teams have had time to double-down on their work, or to re-form, switch ideas, and to discover and push the limits around them.

We're proud of way the teams have handled the pressure, shared their experiences with each other and offered cross-team support. This is a clear testament to the character and passion of the collaborators we have assembled.

It's fair to say we have progress, problems, frustrations, new features - but most of all creative sparks are flying! This has been a really exciting process with much more to come.
