The teams met and worked Saturday during our first co-working session of the 2016 season. It was a great day, spread across two locations in the city.

Half the teams were based at NYU Tandon, the other half at ThoughtWorks New York. We kept a live video feed running all day so that the teams could see each other working and feel part of the same collective.

Some teams were already away with a clear objective in mind, and others were white-boarding trying to figure out what direction they would like to go. There was a high degree of energy and creative juices were flowing.

At the end of the day everyone presented a five-minute summation of their progress, across the live video link so all teams in both locations can keep up with each others progress.
