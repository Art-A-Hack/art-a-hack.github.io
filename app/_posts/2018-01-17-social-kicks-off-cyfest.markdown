Artists, programmers and other creative practitioners all met each other for the first time, and started discussing their project ideas in preparation for the first workshops this weekend.

The discussion was lively as teams tried to plan how they would use their time and how they might take advantage of each other's skills. The teams have a number of very strong concepts, and a mixture of impressive skills.

We have participants from St. Petersburg, and also a large number making the trip from Moscow specifically for Art-A-Hack.

We are working toward presenting final projects in a public opening at the Berthold Centre in St. Petersburg on February 7.
