Having completed our first round of hacking, our teams walked us through their journeys at the awesome new events space <a href="http://new.livestream.com/">Livestream Public</a> in Bushwick.

Each team presented on-stage and showed us some of their outcomes and demos. Thanks to Livestream we have <a href="/summer-2014/journey-presentations/">archived video</a> of the whole show.

We've had some great experiences, exciting insights, and helped create connections between talented people. Finally, we've topped it off with an engaging showcase.

A fantastic evening and looking forward to doing it all again for season 2!
