Today our teams began their first day of hacking at our special edition of Art-A-Hack at [CYFEST 2018](http://cyland.org/lab/program-list/cylandfest/).

This was our first chance for each of the teams to get together and try out their ideas. This is a crucial moment, as theory begins to turn into practice.

In some cases, team members were getting a more concrete sense of exactly what their participation meant, and were questioning and exploring that. In other cases, the team members with the least technical experience were getting a crash course in what is possible.

In other cases, team members were discovering specific technical limitations of their chosen tools, and were working to adjust course as appropriate to their needs. The energy of the teams is high, and each member highly committed to their projects. The day was very positive, and a great start to Art-A-Hack 2018.

We are looking forward to what happens next, as the teams get deeper into the implications of their chosen project ideas.
