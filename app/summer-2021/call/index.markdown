## BeFantastic: Open Call

Imagine a dynamic fellowship of international collaborators, creating works using art & technology, telling compelling stories about the global climate emergency, and amplifying new collective voices. The things we can do TOGETHER!

BeFantastic announces its 2021 fellowship program “TOGETHER”. From the geographies of Singapore, Switzerland, South Asia, U.S.A, and Germany, we call for collaborative practitioners in art, design, and technology to explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML), data & networks around the theme of the climate crisis. Connect with a diverse cohort of global practitioners and seize the opportunity to collaborate on a new format of exhibitable artworks using technology and art (techart).
