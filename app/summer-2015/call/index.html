<p>We are really excited to announce <strong>Art-A-Hack&#8482; 2</strong> - a collaborative creation between groups of artists/engineers, designers/makers, or whatever combination makes sense based on your project proposals.</p>

<p>The first year of Art-A-Hack included collaborations, performances (<a href="/summer-2014/report/">check out the report</a>) and <a href="/blog/final-journey-presentations/">live-streaming of events</a>. This year promises more fantastic opportunities.</p>

<p>Are you interested in taking part? To join the fun and apply now, please read the Open Call below and send your ideas to <a href="mailto:art-a-hack@jahya.net">art-a-hack@jahya.net</a>. We really want to work with you!</p>

<p>The deadline for applications is Sunday May 3rd - early applications are appreciated.</p>

<h2>Open Call</h2>

<p><strong>Art-A-Hack&#8482;</strong> is an open call for artists and engineers, designers and makers - serious creative/technical shoot-for-the stars dreamers who would like to come together to make a BIG impact with some of the newest equipment on the planet.</p>

<p>Here's the deal: we will provide space for four Mondays (10am-6pm) in June, some equipment, listed below (which you are free to use or not use), facilitation and advice, and stellar showcase opportunities. All you need to bring is an open mind and your usual skill set, be it as a maker, engineer, creative artist, or some other skill you tell us about.</p>

<p>We want to hear your ideas and we will team you up with like-minded souls, blasting off into the stratosphere together.</p>

<p>During four Mondays (June 8, 15, 22 &amp; 29) we will co-create at ThoughtWorks New York and other venues. We will have a pre-event social on the evening of Friday May 15th, as well as a well-earned closing party where you can present your final work, chat and network and land back on the planet.</p>

<p>To apply, send your ideas now to <a href="mailto:art-a-hack@jahya.net">art-a-hack@jahya.net</a>. Describe a project idea you want to try, or just the types of projects or technologies you'd like to get into. Include info about your skills, background and what you'd like to contribute.</p>
