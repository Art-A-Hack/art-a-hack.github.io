				<h1>About us</h1>
			</header>

			<p>Art-A-Hack&#8482; brings artists, engineers and technology together to make in a new way.</p>

			<p>Inspired by the possibilities at the intersection of technology and art, we believe engaging and inspiring innovations take place when people with different backgrounds come together with an open mind and create - with no restrictions.</p>

			<p>Our approach is to match up participants responding to an open call. We bring the teams together and provide equipment, facilitation and a collaborative workspace in New York City.</p>
