				<h1>About us</h1>
			</header>

			<p>The Art-A-Hack program brings artists, engineers and technology together to make in a new way.</p>

			<p>We are inspired by the possibilities at the intersection of technology and art. We believe that engaging and inspiring innovations take place when people with different backgrounds get together with an open mind. So, we propose an experiment in which individual artists and technologist get together and create - with no restrictions.</p>

			<p>Our approach is to match up participants responding to an open call. We bring the teams together and provide equipment, facilitation and a collaborative workspace in New York City.</p>
