<p>During four Saturdays (June 11, 18, 25 &amp; July 9) we will co-create at Thoughtworks New York, and NYU Tandon. There will be a pre-event social on the evening of Wednesday, June 8, as well as a well-earned closing party July 15  to present your final work, chat, network and land back on the planet.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>To apply, send your ideas now to <a href="mailto:call2016@artahack.io">call2016@artahack.io</a>. Describe a project idea you want to try, the technologies you'd like to get into, or the skills you have to contribute.</p>

<p>When we receive your applications, we will match you up with others to help you achieve your ambitions.</p>

<p>Each year we group people together around the most compelling proposals. This means your specific idea may not be selected, in which case we will try to find you a team and a project which matches your skills and interests.</p>

<p>This is an ad-hoc process, and we can't always match everybody to teams, but we work hard to create aligned teams and have had great results from the process.</p>
