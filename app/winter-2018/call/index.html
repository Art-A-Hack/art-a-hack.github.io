<p>This year our partner is <strong>CYBERFEST</strong> of the <strong>CYLAND MEDIA ART LAB</strong>, St. Petersburg, Russia, and promises more fantastic opportunities!</p>

<p>Are you interested in taking part? To apply now, please read the Open Call below and send your ideas to <strong><a href="mailto:aazavediy@gmail.com">aazavediy@gmail.com</a></strong>. We really want to work with you!</p>

<p>Make sure you are available to take part on the dates of <strong>January 21, 22, 28, 29</strong>. If you cannot commit to those specific dates then please reconsider your application. Send us your ideas, we'll team you up with like-minded souls, and you can blast off into the stratosphere together.</p>

<p>The deadline for applications is <strong>December 7, 2017</strong> - early applications are very much appreciated.</p>

<h2>Open Call</h2>

<p>Here's the deal: we will provide space for two weekends (10am-6pm) in January <strong>(January 21, 22, 28, 29)</strong>, equipment, facilitation and advice, and stellar showcase opportunities.</p>

<p>During two weekends we will co-create at a site provided by the festival. There will be a pre-event social on January 17, as well as presenting finished prototypes at CYBERFEST 2018 in February.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply, send your ideas now to <strong><a href="mailto:aazavediy@gmail.com">aazavediy@gmail.com</a></strong>. This year’s topic is “Weather forecast: digital cloudiness”. Describe a project idea you want to try, the technologies you'd like to get into, or the skills you have to contribute. If you are an artist and do not have tech skills, that is ok. Conversely, if you are a programmer and don’t have any compelling ideas, that is ok as well. If you have any special equipment you can contribute, we welcome you to tell us. When we receive your applications, we will match you up with others to help you achieve your ambitions.</p>

<p>Please include info on any technical tools or programs you know, or a project proposal you have. If you want to focus on a subject area or social issue, let us know. Each year we group people together around the most compelling proposals. This means your specific idea may not be selected, in which case we will try to find you a team and a project which matches your skills and interests.</p>

<p>This is an ad-hoc process, and we can't always match everybody to teams, but we work hard to create aligned teams and have had great results from the process.</p>
