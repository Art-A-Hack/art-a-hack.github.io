Using the natural reflex of blinking, this team created a prototype allowing viewers to edit, through jump cuts, a YouTube video in real-time.

Inspired by Walter Murch's [book of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Blink_of_an_Eye_(book)), the team asked the question of how video editing might be enhanced using emerging technologies such as blink detection and Computer Vision.

The team used [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), an open source computer vision and machine learning software library, with a high-end webcam to create the installation.

Viewers were able to try out the installation and edit videos directly, which was presented during the final exhibition of CyFest in 2018.
