The *Hieroglyph* team collaborated remotely from locations in Kiev, Ukraine, Bangalore, India, Tallinn, Estonia, New York and Fresno in the USA, and Sao Paolo, Brazil to create an augmented live streamed performance with sound and visuals driven by the biometrics of dancer Razvan Stoian.

The team drew upon language describing the perceptual experience of otherness, shifting between Stoian's native tongue of Romanian and adopted speech in English.

The work used both interactive visuals and audio to evoke the tension of moving through unfamiliar landscapes, both literal and perceptual. 

Data collected from an [Emotibit biosensor](https://www.emotibit.com/) on Stoian’s finger measured his blood oxygen and muscle tension. That data changed the color, size, speed, and sound of the cascade of graphically generated words and interactivity of his body on the screen with those words.

The choreography was a study in contrasts: turbulence and calm, dark and light, highlighting reflections of inner and outer worlds.

Team members, including generative composers, sound designers, artists, creative technologists and art directors  connected remotely to a broadcasting system set up in the studio to work with Hussein and develop the performance.

The _Hieroglyph_ live performance was the culmination of the team working virtually for six weeks during COVID-19 isolation. The performance had its world premiere at the 39th annual [Battery Dance Festival](https://batterydance.org/battery-dance-festival/), also entirely online, using the innovative artist-led [eˉlektron live streaming platform](https://elektron.art/).
