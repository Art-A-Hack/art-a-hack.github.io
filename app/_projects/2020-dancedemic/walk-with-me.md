Team Hussein created *Walk With Me* collaborating remotely from London UK, Sao Paolo Brazil, New York, Orlando, and Tallinn Estonia to create an augmented live streamed performance with sound and visuals driven by the biometrics of dancer Hussein Smko.

The team focused on themes of mental strength and resilience in the face of adversity and chaos, inspired by Hussein's memories of growing up in wartime Iraqi Kurdistan.

Hussein wore an [Emotibit biosensor](https://www.emotibit.com/) on his forehead, which the team tapped into wirelessly, translating the realtime data readings into graphic overlays embedded in the live stream.

The biometric data was represented visually in the form of changing multi-colored strokes that surrounded Hussein's body throughout the duration of the performance. The sound environment shifted according to blood oxygen and muscle contraction readings.

In the live performance, Smko embodied the practice of a ronin (a masterless Samurai) where, no matter the situation, one must find calmness from within and stay grounded.

Team members, including engineers, artists, creative technologists, software developers, musicians, and set designers connected remotely to a broadcasting system set up in the studio to work with Hussein and develop the performance.

The piece was broadcast live as part of the 39th annual [Battery Dance Festival](https://batterydance.org/battery-dance-festival/), which in this year was fully virtual due to lockdowns associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The teams used the innovative artist-led [eˉlektron live streaming platform](https://elektron.art/) to engage audiences on the day of the show.
