What can the limits of technology tell us about the limits of communication? The Sonic Equations team explored this question by creating a two-player game which electronically distorts participants’ communication.

The first player reads a script about communication into a microphone. The second player hears an algorithmically-distorted feed of player one’s voice, and tries to interpret as text.

The results are displayed on a screen, updated in real-time so the speaker and audience members can see how the message’s meaning has been conveyed.

The idea was prompted by a peculiar moment in the team’s process, during a video-call meeting with program organizer Ellen Pearlman. Team lead Christopher Edwards, who is hearing-impaired, was relying on assistive technology to interpret. This assistive technology, in the form of an app on a smartphone, created a new layer of interpretation in the communication process.

This layer changed the way meaning was inferred and exchanged by participants in the conversation.

At that moment, the team decided that this incident would become the basis of their project going forward.

The real-time distortion in the game is generated by a customized [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) sound programming environment, created by developer Laura Mun, who had to learn the environment on-the-fly. The program they created manipulates the audio between the two players, allowing distorted segments of sound through.

In essence, this creates a ‘displaced conversation’ event, which embraces and explores the limitations of technological communication.

The team faced challenges in finding just the right sensitivity to apply distortion to the audio feed. If it was too sensitive, background noise and chatter would end up being transmitted. If it was not sensitive enough, soft-spoken players would not be able to participate. The team also overcame obstacles in setting up the microphone to avoid picking up player’s keystrokes.

For the Art-A-Hack 2016 showcase, the team set up the game for visitors to play following their presentation. As the evening progressed, they printed the resulting text from each game played, for audience members to see.

Team lead Christopher explains the rationale: “When technology is stretched, or at it’s seams, this is when you see about the limits and the promises of technology”, as systems “reveal their larger dysfunction”.
