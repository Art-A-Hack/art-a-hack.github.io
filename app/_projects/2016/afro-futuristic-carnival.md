The Afro Futuristic Carnival team used created an interactive virtual reality experience, exploring the Afro Cuban religion of Santeria. In the VR experience, audience members see the graceful dancing of the Goddess Yermaya.

The team created an initial prototype of this experience during Art-A-Hack 2016. The VR environment was constructed in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), with 360 degree sound, and using motion capture (Mocap) to create the elegant character movement.

To capture the smooth movements of dancer Debbie Dias for the Goddess Yermaya avatar, the team used the Mocap studio at the [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/integrated-digital-media-ms). The school partnered with Art-A-Hack for the 2016 season of projects.

One of the unique challenges faced by the team was developing a consistent narrative thread in an interactive VR experience.

The the team broke down their story elements using the hero’s journey. It proved to be an effective strategy, they learned that narrative does not have to be linear to be cohesive.

Another key focus area for the team was the role audio played in the experience. The team felt the music and sound effects should be a ‘guide’ helping users navigate between the virtual worlds presented in the experience. 

Going forward, the team aims to continue developing this project and display it in a museum or exhibition. They would like to use these platforms to retell through personal experience the Afro-diaspora history.

As of August 2016, team member Espii Proctor was awarded an [Oculus Connect 3 Scholarship](http://www.shiift.world/oc3_scholarship/) allowing her to continue moving the project forward.
