The Metaverse Art Gallery team built an art curation platform for the metaverse. The [metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) is social, virtual space on the internet, occupied by visitors using Virtual Reality and 3D applications around the world.

The team's goal was to allow artists, galleries and curators to import 3D art into the metaverse without requiring technical skills. This would allow the metaverse to be used for speculative art shows in virtual-reality spaces.

During Art-A-Hack 2016, the team created an initial prototype of this experience using [AltSpaceVR](http://altvr.com/) as their metaverse platform.

The team initially created a minimalist [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/) sketch of the user interface, illustrated above, allowing placement of 3D artworks in VR. Along with this, they designed a webpage, illustrated below, which could be used to manage and explore 3D art, artists, art shows and digital galleries.

Working from the 3D Unity sketches, developers on the team set to work creating a basic working prototype, illustrated below. This prototype is ready for extension and expansion going forward.

Challenges the team faced included learning the AltspaceVR development platform, as well as [three.js](http://threejs.org/) in a constrained timeframe. Another challenge was making the VR user interface as simple as possible while maintaining all the management capabilities on the website.

The prototype developed was demonstrated for visitors at the Final Presentations in July 2016. The prototype is a work-in-progress, and the intention is to develop it further toward the goal of making it accessible to gallerists and curators.

As of August 2016 the project is being supported by the Altspace Developer Initiative. The grant will allow team lead Samuel Arsenault-­Brassard to work alongside a developer towards the project, now titled “Cultvr.Space”. Progress and updates will be available on the project’s [new site](http://cultvr.space/).
