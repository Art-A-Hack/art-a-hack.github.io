What would it mean to “virtually dissect” your ego, and discover its component parts? This was the question asked by the “Echoing Ego” team, leading to the creation of an installation and performance piece.

The work was demonstrated in the final Art-A-Hack 2016 show, during which team member Julia Frey used her body movement to control a virtual ‘puppet’ projected on the wall.

Team members divided into focus areas based on their interests and talents. Gordey Chernyy wrote visual code in [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/). He was helped by Anirudh Dhullipalla, who also wrote and recorded poetry, played back during the performance.

Mariya Mishurenko coordinated the team and created the beautiful illustrations used in the interactive projections.

Enki Andrews and Julia Frey collaborated on interactive data capture and flow from a [kinect sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) using [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/). Enki also created the interactive sound modulation system using [BEAP](https://github.com/stretta/BEAP/wiki/BEAP-Modular---Overview-and-Install), while Julia crafted and prepared her live performance.

Musician Adriana Molello composed the tone-setting soundtrack for the installation, a recording of which is available [on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/dirtydawn/echoing-ego).

Among the challenges the team faced was learning new technologies. Gordeyy and Anirudh didn’t have previous experience with paper.js, having worked previously in [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/). Maria’s previous experience was in [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and C#.

Inspired by the outcomes of the project, some team members are now working towards creating a related experience for the [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/).
