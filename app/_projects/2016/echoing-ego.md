What would it mean to “virtually dissect” your ego, and discover its components parts?

This was the question asked by the “Echoing Ego” team, leading to the creation of an installation and performance piece.

The work was demonstrated in the final Art-A-Hack 2016 show, during which team member Julia Frey used her body movement to control a virtual ‘puppet’ projected on the wall.

Team members divided their focus areas based on their interests and talents.

Gordey Chernyy wrote visual code in [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) helped by Anirudh Dhullipalla, who also focused on writing and performing poetry. In addition to dance and poetry, Julia Frey developed the [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) patch running the sound.

Enki Andrews worked on interaction design, while Mariya Mishurenko coordinated and created the beautiful illustrations used in the interactive projections.

Musician Adriana Molello composed a soundtrack for the installation, and you can hear the recording here [on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/dirtydawn/echoing-ego).

Technical challenges included the team learning new technologies to build the application. Gordeyy and Anirudh didn’t have previous experience with paper.js, having worked previously in [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/). Maria’s previous experience was in [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and C#.

Inspired by the outcomes of the project, some team members are now working towards creating a related experience for the [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/).
