The Kinect VR project allows multiple participants to interact, real-time, in a virtual reality world via room-scale full body tracking. The system is designed to be used on mobile headsets such as [Samsung Gear VR](http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/gear-vr/).

This approach to body tracking allows participants to feel totally immersed in the VR experience because there are no wires restricting body movement. Participants also see a representation of their entire body rendered below them, and can have full-body interactions with other users in the same physical space.

The project was based on the existing [KinectVR](http://kinectvr.com/) open-source [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) plugin, which allows access to the depth and body-tracking features of a [Microsoft Kinect](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect).

This was the largest team in Art-A-Hack 2016, with a total of six team members. Their goal was to demonstrate the capabilities and unique features of the KinectVR plugin system, and so each team member designed their own unique "virtual world".

During the final Art-A-Hack showcase, players trying out the demo were able to navigate around the different worlds freely, and discover the properties of each.

One of the unique challenges the team faced was rendering the noisy Kinect skeleton data in VR, as multiple bodies tended to break apart when they entered field of view.

This causes particular interaction issues in VR, as discrepancies between a userâ€™s virtual and physical body can lead to dissociative effects.

A playable prototype was demonstrated at the final Art-A-Hack showcase event. The team plans to continue to work on the [open source software application](http://kinectvr.com/) that can be used by developers worldwide.
