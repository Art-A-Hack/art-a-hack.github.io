The Metaverse Art Gallery team built an art curation platform for the metaverse. The [metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) is social, virtual space on the internet, occupied by visitors using Virtual Reality and 3D applications around the world.

The team's goal was to allow artists, galleries and curators to import 3D art into the metaverse without requiring technical skills. This would allow the metaverse to be used for speculative art shows in virtual-reality spaces.

During Art-A-Hack 2016, the team created an initial prototype of this experience using [AltSpaceVR](http://altvr.com/) as their metaverse platform.

The team initially created a minimalist [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/) sketch of the user interface required to place 3D artworks in VR. Along with this, they designed a webpage which could be used to manage and explore 3D art, artists, art shows and digital galleries.

The developers on the team set to work creating a basic working prototype based on the Unity sketches and the website interface.

The team found themselves learning the AltspaceVR development platform, as well as [three.js](http://threejs.org/) in a constrained timeframe. Another challenge was making the VR user interface as simple as possible while maintaining all the management capabilities on the website.

The prototype developed was demonstrated for vistors at the Final Presentations in July 2016. The prototype is a work-in-progress, and the intention is to develop it further.
