Why do so many well-intentioned Western efforts to solve African crises fail? It’s because organizers often have superficial understandings deep problems.

That’s the view explored by the “Superficial / Substantive” team during the Art-A-Hack 2016 season. On the team were two [tech for development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development) experts, Mala Kumar and Linda Raftree, alongside creative technologists Allie Quintano and Leonardo Malave.

The team examined how new technologies, like mobile, virtual and augmented reality, are [clumsily deployed](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/opinion/sunday/solving-all-the-wrong-problems.html?_r=0) by non-experts, often with [generous funding](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/magazine/a-save-the-world-field-trip-for-millionaire-tech-moguls.html) but little long-term experience and sometimes [questionable motives](http://www.adweek.com/agencyspy/apple-store-removes-grey-singapores-i-sea-app-before-it-wins-a-cannes-lions/111538).

The team contend that while those organizations have superficial understandings of deep problems, organizations like Uber and SnapChat have the reverse: deep understandings of superficial problems.

To explore these ideas, the team created a mobile app and VR experience. The app is a satirical take on the way superficial technologically-driven initiatives are structured. The app highlights the way focus is often heavily tilted towards marketing and media, instead of research and understanding of the long-term situation on the ground.

The VR experience places users in a scene from the other side of the equation. Users are positioned next to a water fountain, with shipments of supplies coming in left, right and center. They are then tasked with getting the fountain to produce water, by installing parts from the supply shipments.

The supplies are a mixture of essential components, and useless components sent based on the misconceptions of the marketing campaign and app users funding the initiative. Ultimately, the task of producing water is so prohibitively time-consuming that it negates the original intentions behind the initiative — to provide access to clean water.

The VR application was created using [HTC Vive](http://www.vive.com/), [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), custom C# code and the [Newton VR](http://www.vrinflux.com/newton-vr-physics-based-interaction-on-the-vive/) physics engine. The team created the application using hardware in the [ThoughtWorks VR lab](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/inside-our-brand-new-hack-lab/).

To create the experience, the team overcame challenges in finding and customizing pump-like VR assets in a very short time-frame. They tackled user experience issues such as making sure shipment parts ‘spawned’ at the correct time intervals.

Moving forward, the team are working on packaging the environment into an executable file for download, so that home VR users can try out the experience. Team lead Mala Kumar has also posted a [statement about the project](http://malakumar.com/2016/07/12/art-a-hack-summer-2016/) on her website, and intends to write articles linking the theme of the work with the VR experience.
