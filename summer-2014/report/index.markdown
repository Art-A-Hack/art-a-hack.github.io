It's not the just the end result, it's also the process. Art is privileged here, because in this process there is no right or wrong. Art is a good place to challenge people.

In this inaugural iteration of Art-A-Hack, participants were grouped based on their interests and ideas. Regardless of discipline or subject area, all groups have something in common - they start off on Day 1, and finish up at some end-point.

However, everyone has a different journey. That journey, more than anything else, shapes the outcomes that the teams end up with.

The journey is into new territory - along the way there are false starts, experiments, learning, creativity, and problem-solving. These routes and the thinking behind them are important. They are often just as interesting, informative and useful as what is eventually produced.

Some people have Monday to Friday to work on their ideas outside of Art-A-Hack group sessions, others only have a few days in total. Some participants found themselves having to re-think their ideas from scratch, where others were able to free-wheel without planning too far ahead.

Art-A-Hack has been encouraging people to talk about restrictions and restraints as well as ideas and prototypes. We encourage dialogue around how they responded, how they navigate, and their creative process.
