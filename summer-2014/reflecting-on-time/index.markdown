<h2>Reflecting on Time</h2>

Olga Ast is a designer, author and interdisciplinary artist who investigates connections between space, time and information. Rolf Levenbach is a computer and communications expert with a resume including, among others, Bell Labs, Rutgers University, and the American Museum of Natural History.

The two came together to investigate ideas about how we encode, decode and simulate time and space.

The team effectively worked on two parallel tracks, feeding from each other but working on separate ideas. Olga created a physical installation which subverted the intended purpose of the human-motion detection and display hardware 'Octolively'.

Ast noticed that the Octolively's on-board sensors responded more vigorously to certain physical surfaces than to human hands. She created an installation in which various materials and surfaces hang just in front of a wall-mounted Octolively, inadvertently activating its lights as they sway in the breeze.

Simultaneously, Levenbach investigated flocking algorithms, attempting to show the relationship between time and action of individual elements. This is an alternative view of time to that of the 'frame-based' metaphor of clocks, video or traditional animation.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

In the Octolively installation, many technical challenges were circumvented. This was not about creating a new 'prototype', instead it was about investigating the properties and by-products of existing technology.

A histogram and particle generator kept track of Rolf's iterations. If it was hooked up with Arduino, it could turn on a blinking light, so use the Arduino as an input device.
