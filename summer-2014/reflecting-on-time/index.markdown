<h2>Reflecting on Time</h2>

Olga Ast is a designer, author and interdisciplinary artist. Her practice investigates connections between space, time and information. Rolf Levenbach is a computer and communications expert with a resume that includes Bell Labs, Rutgers University, NYU ITP, and the American Museum of Natural History.

The two investigated how we encode, decode and simulate time and space.

The team developed their ideas in two parallel tracks during their mutual collaboration. Olga created a physical installation which subverted the intended purpose of  human-motion detection and the light sensitive display hardware called 'Octolively'.

Ast noticed Octolively's on-board sensors responded more vigorously to reflective physical surfaces than to the movement of human hands. She created an installation where different reflective materials and surfaces dangled in front of a wall-mounted Octolively, activating its lights as they swayed in the breeze.

Simultaneously, Levenbach delved into flocking algorithms. He showed the relationship between time and the action of individual elements. This is an alternative view of time to that of the 'frame-based' metaphor of clocks, video, or traditional animation.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

In the Octolively installation, many technical challenges were circumvented. This was not about creating a new 'prototype' with the Octolively but about investigating the properties and by-products of existing technology.

A histogram and particle generator kept track of Rolf's iterations. If there had been more time and it had been hooked up with Arduino, it could have turned on a blinking light by using the Arduino as an input device.
