Eva Lee applied with the proposal of creating an installation work based on brain data. This would involve visualizing the data of neuroscientist Dr. Jose Raul Muradas, who has provided key values from electroencephalographic (EEG) studies on participants' sense of self and non-self in meditation.

The data reflected certain similarities and important differences when participants were mediting on the self, or on other people. The idea would be to use programmatic means to visualize and explore the data as an investigation into human identity and consciousness.

During the process, different programmers cycled in and out, and as a result the outcomes were more in the form of animated sketches, sonic and visual.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

In one sketch, a composer used the data as discrete objects or forces taking columns of frequencies. There were 100 sets of numbers with short MP3s for each tone, and the volume was determined by the EEG set of data. 

In another, Maya 3D was used a particle generator.
