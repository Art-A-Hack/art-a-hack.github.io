<h2>Depth, Boundaries and Human Interaction</h2>

Can a compelling human interaction experience be designed around disorientation and confusion? Can we offer interaction in a multimedia installation with a virtual avatar, and then take that avatar away?

The technological paradigm of inferring human body shapes in public space in real-time is still in it's infancy. This team explored the possibilities in such interactions by creating 'virtual breakpoints' around the space which visitors can walk through.

You might walk from a sunny beach, for example, and step forward to find yourself in a city at night. All the time, in each scene you find yourself in, a silhouette taunts you. You can try to approach the mystery figure, but she or he is always one step too far away.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

Most of the coding was done in openFrameworks. Sound design was created with Abelton Live. The visuals with characters, players, stages, and a scene were made in Blender.

An impressively bizarre bug was discovered emanating from one of the plug-ins' relationship with Mavericks: If you don't move the mouse all the time, the computer freezes.

Joelle found that OpenCV and blob tracking were a big technical challenge for the time provided. Tyler had webcam issues with a squiggly blob, would like to have refined it more he made the settings in an XML file.
