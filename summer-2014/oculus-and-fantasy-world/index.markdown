In what new ways can you take an immersive experience like Oculus Rift, and make it more interactive?

This team investigated the nuances of gesture, focusing on hands, body orientation and use of weight.

To do this, they hacked the accelerometer from a cellphone and used it to prototype a weight-distribution controller. You lean forward and your virtual character moves forward. You lean back, and your character moves back.

All three collaborators came from a more creative background, but decided from day one to embrace the technology and development aspect. They were on a steep learning curve, hacking with the Unity 3D modeling / programming environment, and the Leap Motion hand-gesture controller all at the same time.

The team will be showing their project at World Maker Faire NYC in September.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

The team tried to figure out how to work with the Leap Motion in Unity where they could hold an object and bring an environment together but it did not work. With the Leap motion sensor attached to Oculus you can see your finger.

With their hacked full-body sensor, there is an issue with balance - stabilizing the active effect of a balancing tilter while wearing the Oculus. The project was coded in C# and Javascript, which was new to the team. They used a smartphone app called Unity Remote to link the phone's accelerometer with Unity 3D.
