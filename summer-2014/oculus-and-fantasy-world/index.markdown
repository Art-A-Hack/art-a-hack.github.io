In what new ways can you take an immersive experience like Oculus Rift, and make it more interactive?

This team investigated the nuances of gesture, focusing on hands, body orientation and use of weight.

To do this, they hacked the gyroscope from a cellphone ad used it to prototype a weight-distribution controller. You lean forward and your virtual character moves forward. You lean back, and your character steps back.

All three collaborators came from a more creative background, but decided from day one to embrace the technology and development aspect. They were on a steep learning curve, hacking with the Unity 3D modelling / programming environment, and the Leap Motion hand-gesture controller all at the same time.

The team also applied with their project for MakerFair in September.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

The team tried to figure out how to work with the Leap Motion in Unity where they could hold an object and bring an environment together but it did not work. With the Leap motion sensor attached to Oculus you can see your finger.

With their hacked full-body sensor, there is an issue with balance - stabilizing the active effect of a balancing tilter while wearing the Oculus. The project was coded in C# and Java, which was new to the team. Unity Remote does mirror information on a smart phone.
