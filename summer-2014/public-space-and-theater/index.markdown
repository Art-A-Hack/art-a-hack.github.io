How can computing and portable sound devices change the way we communicate in public spaces? This team explored that question relentlessly, posing and critiquing several location-specific augmentations.

The team came to be captivated by the Whispering Gallery at Grand Central Station. This space has a natural acoustic property that emerges from the arched ceiling architecture. If you stand in one corner and speak, somebody way over in the other corner can listen and hear you clearly - even though those people standing in-between cannot.

A concept emerged from the idea that these 'hidden conversations' need not be lost to time. A small, portable micropohone, speaker, and small battery-powered computing device could allow people to leave messages behind that can be experienced after-the-fact by those on the opposite wall.

In a way, this evokes Grand Central Station's rich history. Countless conversations, lives, hopes, dreams and desires have passed through this space. This team's work will allow a little of that to be captured and remembered, even for a few moments longer.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

The computing device is Rasberry Pi. Javier was learning the tech stack from scratch, and had a lot of ground to cover, but fortunately the Pi is well-supported.

The team had to consider problems of power. Which speakers can be powered at what volume and for how long?

When working in such heavily-guarded public space, permission is critical, and takes time to achieve.
