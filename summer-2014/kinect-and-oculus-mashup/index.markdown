Can virtual reality be informed by a new kind of augmented reality? What happens when we create a virtual boundary through which we can view a window into reality?

These were the questions Jason Levine and Noah Pivick addressed in their experiments mashing the Kinect depth sensor and the Oculus Rift.

Their first answer was almost obvious - it makes you feel sick, very quickly.

This team fought forward and searched for the limitations and sweet spots. They explored innovative ideas such as offering 'reverse views' of the world, and making subtle shifts in the representations of the world experienced by the viewer.

<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>

The team created the mashup in the openFrameworks creative coding environment. This already had addons for both Kinect and Oculus, so the main technical challenge was pairing the two in different combinations.

The hardware failed in week one, and a new power supply was needed for the Oculus. These are some of the real problems of working with hardware!

The Kinect does not like mirrors, or sunlight, anything that screws up depth sensing, and so the picture being built will always be incomplete. There is a particular 'Kinect aesthetic' which emerges from the incompleteness of the data.
